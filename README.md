# 🌿 SpringBootProjects

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Lab** — a living collection of Java + Spring Boot applications crafted to explore ideas, build reusable modules, and demonstrate backend engineering expertise.

> 🚧 Always evolving. Always building.

## ⚙️ About This Repository

This repository is a **technical playground** where I continuously build and refine production-grade Spring Boot applications. From security modules and RESTful APIs to service orchestration and integrations — each addition showcases real-world backend development practices.

## 🧰 Technologies & Concepts

- 🌱 **Spring Boot** — Fast, opinionated Java framework for modern backend development  
- 📦 **Maven** — Dependency management and build automation  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** — Layered MVC + DAO + Service patterns  
- 💾 **MySQL / JDBC** — Persistent data management with optimized queries  
- 🛡️ **Security Implementations** — OTP systems, encrypted storage, validation mechanisms  
- ✉️ **JavaMail API** — Integration with email services (SMTP)  
- 🧪 **Clean Code Principles** — Maintainable, scalable, and testable Java

## 🛠️ Development Philosophy

> 💡 *Code should be simple, readable, and reliable.*

This repo is a demonstration of:
- Clear **separation of concerns**
- **Reusability** through modular components
- Thoughtful handling of **configurations** and **sensitive data**
- Adherence to **best practices** in project structure and version control

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Whether it's automating a system, building REST APIs, or experimenting with new ideas — this repository reflects my passion for:
- **Problem-solving through code**
- **Engineering secure, maintainable systems**
- **Continuous learning in the Java ecosystem**

## 🔒 Secure by Design

This repository **intentionally excludes** sensitive files like `config.properties` using `.gitignore`.  
You’ll find external integrations implemented **safely and modularly** for real-world adaptability.
